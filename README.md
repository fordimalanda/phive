# Phive (PHP Live Server)

Phive is a professional Visual Studio Code extension designed to streamline PHP development by providing a modern, live-reloading environment. It eliminates the need for manual browser refreshes and complex server configurations, making it ideal for both local and cross-device testing.

## Core Features

- **Instant PHP Server**: Launch a built-in PHP server instance directly from your workspace with a single click.
- **Smart Live Reloading**: Automatically refreshes connected browsers (desktop and mobile) upon saving `.php`, `.html`, `.css`, `.js`, or `.json` files.
- **Port Conflict Resolution**: Automatically detects if port 8000 or the WebSocket port is occupied by another application and switches to the next available port, preventing environment crashes.
- **Network Sharing**: Automatically detects your local IPv4 address, allowing seamless testing on mobile devices or tablets connected to the same network.
- **Integrated Request Logging**: Real-time output channel providing detailed logs of incoming HTTP requests and server status.
- **Multi-root Workspace Support**: Intelligent folder selection for developers working on multiple projects simultaneously.
- **Customizable PHP Path**: Support for custom PHP binary locations, ensuring compatibility with XAMPP, WAMP, Laragon, or standalone PHP installations.
- **Automated Routing**: Generates a temporary, hidden router script to handle asset serving and WebSocket injection without polluting your project structure.

## Requirements

- **PHP**: PHP must be installed on your system.
- **Environment**: By default, the extension expects the `php` executable to be in your system's PATH.

## Installation

1. Open Visual Studio Code.
2. Navigate to the Extensions view (`Ctrl+Shift+X`).
3. Search for `Phive` and click Install.

## Configuration

Phive provides the following configuration options through VS Code Settings (`Ctrl+,`):

- `phive.phpPath`: Specifies the absolute path to the PHP executable. Set this if `php` is not in your system PATH (e.g., `C:\xampp\php\php.exe` on Windows).

- `phive.port`: Specifies the preferred local port for the PHP server instance (Default: `8000`). Ideal for restrictive local network environments or static proxy routing rules.

## Usage

1. **Start the Server**: Open a PHP project folder. Click the **Phive: Go Live** button in the Status Bar (bottom right) or use the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` -> `Phive: Start PHP Server`).
2. **Select Folder**: If using a multi-root workspace, select the specific project folder you wish to serve.
3. **Development**: The extension will automatically open your default browser. Any changes saved to supported files will trigger an immediate reload across all connected devices.
4. **Stop the Server**: Click the active server info in the Status Bar or use the `Phive: Stop PHP Server` command.

## Technical Overview

Phive utilizes a WebSocket-based architecture (`ws` library) to maintain a persistent connection between the server and the client. During execution, it injects a lightweight JavaScript client into the PHP output stream via a temporary router file (`.phive_router.php`). This router file is automatically hidden from the VS Code File Explorer and securely deleted upon server termination to maintain workspace cleanliness.
